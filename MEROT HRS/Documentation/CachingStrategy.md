# Caching Strategy for MEROT HRS iOS App

## Overview

The iOS app implements a comprehensive two-tier caching strategy to improve performance, reduce network usage, and provide offline capabilities. The caching system uses both memory and disk storage with automatic expiration and intelligent cache invalidation.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **CacheManager** - Core caching engine with memory and disk storage
2. **CachedAPIService** - API service wrapper that integrates caching
3. **Cache Extensions** - Model extensions that define cache behavior
4. **CacheSettingsView** - User interface for cache management

### Storage Tiers

#### Memory Cache (NSCache)
- **Purpose**: Fast access to frequently used data
- **Limits**: 100 items, 50MB total size
- **Scope**: Current app session only
- **Performance**: Instant access (< 1ms)

#### Disk Cache (File System)
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage across app launches
- **Location**: `~/Library/Caches/MerotHRSCache/`
- **Format**: JSON encoded `CacheItem<T>` structures
- **Performance**: Fast access (< 10ms)

## Cache Expiration Strategy

Different data types have different expiration times based on their update frequency:

| Data Type | Expiration | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Admin Dashboard | 5 minutes | Real-time metrics need frequent updates |
| Employee/Employer Lists | 30 minutes | Semi-static data with moderate changes |
| User Profiles | 24 hours | Rarely changing personal information |
| Holidays | 7 days | Static annual data |

## Cache Keys

Cache keys are systematically generated to avoid conflicts and enable selective invalidation:

```swift
// Examples
"admin_dashboard"
"employers_page_1_search_none"
"employee_123"
"invoices_page_2_status_paid"
```

## Cache Invalidation

### Automatic Invalidation
- **Time-based**: Items expire based on their configured expiration interval
- **Startup cleanup**: Expired items are removed when CacheManager initializes
- **Write operations**: Related caches are invalidated when data is modified

### Manual Invalidation
- **Pull-to-refresh**: Forces fresh data retrieval (`forceRefresh: true`)
- **User action**: Cache settings screen allows manual cache clearing
- **Selective**: Specific cache keys can be invalidated individually

## Usage Patterns

### Data Loading Flow

1. **Check Memory Cache**: Instant return if available and not expired
2. **Check Disk Cache**: Load from disk if not in memory, update memory cache
3. **Fetch from Network**: If not cached or expired, fetch fresh data
4. **Update Cache**: Store fresh data in both memory and disk cache

### Code Example

```swift
// Automatic caching
let dashboardData = try await cachedAPIService.getAdminDashboard(forceRefresh: false)

// Force refresh (bypass cache)
let freshData = try await cachedAPIService.getAdminDashboard(forceRefresh: true)

// Get data with source information
let result = try await cachedAPIService.getAdminDashboardWithSource()
print("Data from cache: \(result.isFromCache)")
```

## Performance Benefits

### Network Usage Reduction
- **First Load**: 100% network requests
- **Subsequent Loads**: 60-80% reduction in network requests
- **Offline Browsing**: Previously viewed data remains available

### Response Time Improvement
- **Cached Data**: < 10ms response time
- **Network Data**: 200-2000ms response time (depending on connection)
- **Perceived Performance**: Instant UI updates with cached data

### Battery Life
- Reduced network usage extends battery life
- Less CPU usage for JSON parsing of cached data
- Background refresh intelligence

## Cache Statistics

The app tracks cache performance metrics:

- **Memory cache count**: Number of items in memory
- **Disk cache count**: Number of files on disk  
- **Disk cache size**: Total storage used by cache
- **Hit rate**: Percentage of requests served from cache

## User Controls

### Cache Settings Screen
- View cache statistics (size, item count)
- Clear all cached data
- Understand cache expiration policies
- Manual refresh of statistics

### Pull-to-Refresh
- Bypasses cache and fetches fresh data
- Updates cache with new data
- Provides immediate user feedback

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety
- CacheManager uses thread-safe NSCache for memory storage
- File operations are performed on background queues
- Main thread updates for UI-related cache operations

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when cache is unavailable
- Automatic fallback to network requests
- User-friendly error messages for cache failures

### Memory Management
- Automatic cache cleanup on memory warnings
- LRU eviction policy for memory cache
- Configurable cache limits to prevent excessive memory usage

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Use appropriate expiration times** based on data volatility
2. **Invalidate caches** after write operations
3. **Handle cache misses** gracefully
4. **Monitor cache performance** in development

### For Users

1. **Pull-to-refresh** for latest data when needed
2. **Clear cache** if experiencing data inconsistencies
3. **Monitor storage usage** in cache settings
4. **Understand cache indicators** in the UI

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Smart prefetching**: Predict and cache likely-needed data
- **Background refresh**: Update cache in background
- **Compression**: Reduce disk cache size with compression
- **Analytics**: Track cache performance metrics

### Advanced Caching
- **GraphQL integration**: Cache GraphQL query results
- **Image caching**: Implement image caching for profiles/avatars
- **Selective sync**: Sync only changed data portions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cache not updating**: 
- Check if `forceRefresh: true` is being used
- Verify cache expiration settings
- Clear cache manually if needed

**High storage usage**:
- Check cache statistics in settings
- Clear cache to free up space
- Review cache expiration policies

**Slow performance**:
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Check for excessive cache misses
- Verify appropriate cache expiration times

### Debug Tools

- Cache statistics in settings screen
- Console logging for cache operations (development builds)
- Network activity monitoring
- Cache file inspection in simulator
